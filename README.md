FlappyBirdClone
===============
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fork of: https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird
I'm just adding a login form and highscore functionality to the app!
I also updated flappy.py to work with python3 (it probably won't work with python2 anymore...)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A Flappy Bird Clone made using [python-pygame][1]

How-to
------

1. I̶n̶s̶t̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶P̶y̶t̶h̶o̶n̶ ̶2̶.̶7̶.̶X̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶[̶h̶e̶r̶e̶]̶(̶h̶t̶t̶p̶s̶:̶/̶/̶w̶w̶w̶.̶p̶y̶t̶h̶o̶n̶.̶o̶r̶g̶/̶d̶o̶w̶n̶l̶o̶a̶d̶/̶r̶e̶l̶e̶a̶s̶e̶s̶/̶)̶
get python 3

2. Install PyGame 1.9.X from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
^^ get a version that works with python3

3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sourabhv/FlappyBirdClone.git` or click `Download ZIP` in right panel and extract it.

4. Run `python flappy.py` from the repo's directory to start the game directly, or 'python login.py' to try the login app that I made

5. use <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key to play and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the game. (pressing the X button works for me)

  (Note: Install pyGame for same version python as above)

  (For x64 windows, get exe [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame))
